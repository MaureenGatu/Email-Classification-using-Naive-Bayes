# Email-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes

This repository contains a mini-project focused on email classification. The goal of this project is to classify a set of emails into two categories: those written by one person and those written by another person, both working at the same company. 
This classification is based solely on the text content of the emails. We will begin by implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm in this mini-project and expand our exploration to other machine learning algorithms in future projects.


## Project Overview

In this project, we are provided with a dataset consisting of a list of email texts. These emails have already undergone some basic preprocessing. 
The primary task is to build a classifier that can accurately distinguish between emails written by one person and emails written by another person within the same company.


## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

* data/: This directory contains the dataset of emails for training and testing.

* src/: Here, you will find the source code for email classification.

* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.

* requirements.txt: A list of required Python packages and their versions.


## Dataset
The dataset consists of a set of email texts, with half written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company. The data has been preprocessed and is ready for classification.

## Next Steps
This is just the beginning of our email classification project. In future projects, we plan to explore more advanced machine learning algorithms and techniques to improve the accuracy of email classification.

You can suggest improvements, experiment with different algorithms, and share your insights through issues and pull requests.

Thank you for your interest in this email classification project! If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy classifying! ðŸ“§ðŸ¤–
